### Functional Programming Concepts ###

**In Imperative programming**

- Variables as mechanism for associate a value and a name.
- A sequence of commands
 
**In Functional programming**
	- Based on structured function calls
	- Functions calls other functions
	- Names are only used as formal parameters
	- There is not concept of commands

**Imperative**

- [Names]
	- The same name may be associated with different values.
- [Execution Order]
	- Values associated with names can be changed.
	- The order of commands forms a contract.
- [Repetition]
	- Repetition is produced by loop structures. (Explicit and External)

**Functional**
- [Names]
	- A name is only ever associated with one value.
- [Execution Order]
	- The values associated with names cannot be changed.
	- The order execution does not affect the result.
- [Repetition]
	- Repetition is produced by nesting function calls. (Recursion)

**Function as Values**

Functional programming allows to pass behaviour as values, by allowing
function to be treated as values.
